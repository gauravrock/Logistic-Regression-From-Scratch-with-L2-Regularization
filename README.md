# Logistic-Regression-From-Scratch-with-L2-Regularization
Python Implementation of Logistic Regression for Binary Classification from Scratch with L2 Regularization.

<b>What is Logistic Regression?</b>

<p>Itâ€™s a classification algorithm, that is used where the response variable is categorical. The idea of Logistic Regression is to find a relationship between features and probability of particular outcome.</p>

E.g. When we have to predict if a student passes or fails in an exam when the number of hours spent studying is given as a feature, the response variable has two values, pass and fail.
This type of a problem is referred to as Binomial Logistic Regression, where the response variable has two values 0 and 1 or pass and fail or true and false. Multinomial Logistic Regression deals with situations where the response variable can have three or more possible values.
